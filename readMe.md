**Inspiration:**
We wanted to create a project that is fun to play and look at while also providing information about Canada as a nation and as a community. 
Our team is composed of individuals whose families do not originate from Canada and as a result, we often get questions about what Canada is like. 
Often, people around the world view Canada as a cold, harsh climate where everyone is just extremely nice. 
We wanted to allow people to see the real Canada and learn more about this nation with our project.

**What it does:**
The project is a web-based game which utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to present three different screens.
The first is the introduction screen where it introduces the concept and provides instructions on how to play the game. 
The next screen is the character selection screen in which users can choose from four different iconic and symbolic Canadian animals, the beaver, the bear, the moose, and the fox.
And finally, the third screen is a screen which contains a four by four grind to hold 16 different images of very symbolic Canadian places, animals, and items. 
Then, there is a button on the same screen which allows the user to roll a die, producing an output between one to six. 
After this, there is a pop-up on the screen notifying the user the current square they are now on and providing a short description of that particular image on the square. 
It is meant to be a fun and informative game for anyone to play!

**How we built it:**
We built this project by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to produce a 3 piece webpage. 
In index.html, different classes were used within div elements to produce characters and titles for the game. 
JavaScript was used to carry out functions for the program, such as functions used for relaunching the webpage and hiding and displaying certain aspects of the project based on 
mouse clicks along with producing the algorithm for moving the pieces based on the randomly generated number (dice). 
Furthermore, CSS was used to make the project more appealing and aesthetic for the user and to provide a nicer overall experience.
